# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — Experimental development version

- AI-led new-feature and existing-case testing Skill for installed Ego Lite.
- Separate reusable guidance, private project resources and local run evidence.
- Optional dependency-free Node helpers; no browser driver or model API wrapper.
- Versioned test asset contracts, synthetic examples and bilingual visual docs.
- Privacy-oriented publication boundary and local structural checks.

Validation on 2026-10-21 (Linux, Node v24.19.0):
- 67/67 synthetic local tests passed; no failures or skipped tests.
- Current publication allowlist, relative links and heuristic privacy check passed.
- Five generated artifact types validated with Draft 2020-12 schemas using the
  already-available development validator, including local references and formats.
- Skill metadata validated; isolated Skill-copy reference links checked.
- Eight original bilingual PNG diagrams visually inspected; metadata reviewed.

Review fixes include rejecting result fields that shadow the baseline, accurate
operator-supplied outcome labels, pre-rendering reports, and suppressing possible
credential values in publication-check diagnostics.

No Windows/Ego application run or AI testing accuracy is claimed. Python's
development validator and optional image renderer are not helper runtime dependencies.
